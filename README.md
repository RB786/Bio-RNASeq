Bio-RNASeq - Legacy Branch
==========================

The Bio-RNASeq code was extracted from a previous codebase called vr-codebase.

The legacy branch was created in order to preserve the commit history of the extracted modules and script in the new codebase.

Discussions between js21 and ss34 led to the creation of a seprate branch for the previous commit history.

A merge is possible, but it would be chronologically messy. Technically it would be correct as the old commit history was added after the code was extracted.

If merged, tools such as git bissect would be less efficient.
